###Score

**3 - Pass**
met and exceeded all assignment expectations



###Comments:

*I like how you named the package "DSDataFrameTools", which makes it more likely to see general used in the future

*both functions run

*additionally, both of the functions are straightforward and clearly understood by a reader

*its excellent that you commented docstrings for your functions, a good practice that was also part of the stretch goals

*the README.md is also has a clear example and explanation for each function

*i would suggest trying to add more niche and complex functions in the future
